# Ping Pong JavaScript Practice | Epicodus

**AUTHOR:** Ginger Lee Kretschmer

## Description

This is my 4th code review for the Epicodus Introduction to Programming Summer/Fall 2015 course. Here I have created a webpage that prompts the user to input a number between 1 - 100 and then it will output a list of all the numbers leading up to that entered number, with multiples of 3 displaying 'ping' and multiples of 5 displaying 'pong', and multiples of *both* 3 and 5 displaying 'pingpong'.
