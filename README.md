# Ginger's Ping Pong Code Review | Epicodus

**AUTHOR:** Ginger Lee Kretschmer

## Description

This is my 4th code review for the Epicodus Introduction to Programming Summer/Fall 2015 course. Here I have created a webpage that prompts the user to input a number between 1 - 100 and then it will output a list of all the numbers leading up to that entered number, with multiples of 3 saying Ping and multiples of 5 saying pong, and multiples of 3 and 5 saying PingPong.

## Setup

```sh
https://github.com/gingerlee/pingpong.git
```

## Technologies Used
